# Round Robin Scheduler
__Inspiration for Program__

In my Operating Systems class, we had to create a program to calculate the average turnaround time for a Round Robin algorithm. I thought this was GitHub worthy so I'm going to post my program.

__User Input__

1. Number of Processes in System
2. Arrival Time for Each Process
3. CPU Burst for Each Process
4. Quantum Time

__Output__

1. A Table Containing:
* Process Number
* Arrival time
* CPU Burst time
* Turnaround time 

2. Average Turnaround Time for the System
