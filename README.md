# RoundRobinScheduler
_Inspiration for Program_
In my Operating Systems class, we had to create a program to calculate the average turnaround time for a Round Robin algorithm. I thought this was GitHub worthy so I'm going to post my program.

_User Input_
1. Number of Processes in System
2. Arrival Time for Each Process
3. CPU Burst for Each Process
4. Quantum Time
_Output_
1. A Table Containing:
⋅⋅* Process NUmber
⋅⋅* Arrival time
⋅⋅* CPU Burst time
⋅⋅* Turnaround time 
2. Average Turnaround Time for the System
